## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out the profile card component and get it looking as close as the provided design as possible. 
This challenge was done without access to the design files and rather by estimating sizes of elements. However, the style guide provided by Frontend Mentor helped by providing colors, font-sizes, font-family, etc.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- SCSS

### What I learned

In this challenge I had hands on experience using positioning to place elements exactly where I wanted. It was difficult to understand intially, but thanks to the resources I found on the internet I was able to place the two large circle elements apart of the background similar to the design for mobile and desktop devices. These images are also very large by default so I discovered the overflow property to hide the rest of the images since they overflowed the viewport height and width once positioned.
